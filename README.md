# [Image-Dog-Breed-Classifier](https://github.com/phamou/Image-Dog-Breed-Classifier)
## Overview
When I see a dog and happen to take a picture of it, I would love to know what breed it is. This notebook is to apply deep learning methods to identify the breed of these cute fluffs and present my results through data visualization.

## Technologies used:
* TensorFlow
* TensorHub (MobileNetV2)
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

### Result visualization

### Custom picked images to test external cases
